# Enabling Kiosk Mode in Grafana 12 (GUI Method)

Follow these steps to hide the sidebar, top navigation, and dashboard controls for a clean, full-screen display.

### Prerequisites
* Ensure you are running **Grafana 12** (released 2025).
* You must have at least **Viewer** permissions for the dashboard you wish to display.

### Steps to Enable via UI
1. **Open your Dashboard**: Navigate to the specific dashboard you want to display in kiosk mode.
2. **Locate the Kiosk Icon**: In the top right corner of the dashboard header, find the **Kiosk Mode** icon (typically represented by a monitor or an "expand" symbol).
3. **Activate Kiosk Mode**: Click the icon once. This will immediately hide the main menu and sidebars.
4. **Cycle Modes (Optional)**: In some versions of Grafana 12, clicking the icon again may cycle between "Kiosk" (hides sidebar/top nav) and "Kiosk TV" (hides almost all UI elements except the panels).

### How to Exit
*   **Keyboard**: Press the `Esc` key on your keyboard to return to the standard interface.
*   **Shortcut**: You can also toggle this mode off by pressing `d` then `k` in quick succession.
