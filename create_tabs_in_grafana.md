# Grafana Tutorial: Create Tabs with Dashboard Links (Step-by-Step)

## Step 1: Open Your Dashboard
- Navigate to the dashboard where you want to add tabs.
- Click Edit, Settings or the **gear icon** (⚙️) in the top-right corner to open **Dashboard Settings**.

## Step 2: Go to Links Section
- In the left menu of Dashboard Settings, click **Links**.
- This is where you can add navigation links to other dashboards.

## Step 3: Add a New Dashboard Link
- Click **Add Link**/**New Link**
- Configure:
  - **Type:** Dashboard
  - **Dashboard:** Select the dashboard you want to link to.
  - **Title:** Give it a name (e.g., *Performance*, *Errors*, *Overview*).
  - **Icon (optional):** Choose an icon for better visuals.
- Click **Add**.

## Step 4: Save the Dashboard
- Click **Save** at the top.
- Your new link will appear at the top of the dashboard, acting like a tab.

## Step 5: Repeat for More Tabs
- Add more links for other dashboards to create a tab-like navigation experience.

### Extra Tip
- You can also use **variables** for dynamic content instead of multiple dashboards, but links are the easiest way for a tab effect.
